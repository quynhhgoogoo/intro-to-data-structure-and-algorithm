/*Standard library static array*/

array <int, 5> ax = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};	/*array with type int fixed size as 5 and uses ax as name of variables => wrap function*/
1. ax.front() : first element inside the array
2. ax.back() : final element inside the array
3. var.pushback(x) : only in dynamic array, put x as final variable in the end of array

- compile time initialized
- stored on stack

2. Dynamic Array
