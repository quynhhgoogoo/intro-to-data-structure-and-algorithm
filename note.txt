/*Standard library static array*/

array <int, 5> ax = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};	/*array with type int fixed size as 5 and uses ax as name of variables => wrap function*/
1. ax.front() : first element inside the array
2. ax.back() : final element inside the array
3. var.pushback(x) : only in dynamic array, put x as final variable in the end of array

1. Static Array
- compile time initialized
- stored on stack

2. Dynamic Array
- is an array which is created at runtime
- grow/shrink throughout the life of running program
- allocated and delocated on the heap

3. Recursion : a problem that can be broke down into smaller sub-problems
- Vector : is a list of arrays

4. Stack : collection of elements in which items are added and removed in LIFO (Last in First Out)
- adding elements : a push on stack
- removing elements : a pop on stack

5. Queue : container for items/elements in which we add and remove from FIFO (First In First Out)
- dequeing : move items out
- enqueing : add items in
